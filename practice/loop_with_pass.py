# loop_with_pass.py

# Problem 1: Using pass inside a loop (placeholder for future logic).
for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        pass  # Placeholder, doesn't affect loop execution
    print(num)

# Problem 2: Defining an empty function using pass.
def my_function():
    pass  # To be implemented later

# Problem 3: Using pass inside a class definition.
class MyClass:
    pass  # Placeholder for class attributes and methods
