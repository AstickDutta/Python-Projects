ðŸ”´ Polymorphism:
ðŸ”´ For example, say we have three classes: Car, Boat, and Plane, and they all have a method called move()..:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand =  brand

class Boat:

        self.brand =  brand
        self.model = model
    
    def move(self):

class Plane:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand =  brand
        self.model = model

    def move(self):
        print("Fly")

for i in (car1, boat1, plane1):
