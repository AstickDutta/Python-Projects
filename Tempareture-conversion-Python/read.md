# This Python program converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
# The steps involved are as follows:
# 1. The user is asked to input the temperature unit ('C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit).
# 2. The user is then prompted to enter the temperature value.
# 3. If the unit is 'C' (Celsius), the program converts the temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula: (C * 9/5) + 32.
# 4. If the unit is 'F' (Fahrenheit), the program converts the temperature to Celsius using the formula: (F - 32) * 5/9.
# 5. The result is displayed in the converted unit.
# 6. If the user enters an invalid unit, an error message is printed.
