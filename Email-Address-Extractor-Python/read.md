# This Python program extracts the **username** and **domain** from a given email address.
# It performs the following steps:
# 
# 1. **Input**: The user is prompted to input their email address.
# 2. **Validation**: The program checks if the email address contains the "@" symbol.
#    - If the "@" symbol is found, the program proceeds to extract the username and domain.
#    - If the "@" symbol is missing, the program prints an error message indicating an invalid email address.
# 3. **Extraction**:
#    - **Username**: The part of the email before the "@" symbol.
#    - **Domain**: The part of the email after the "@" symbol.
# 4. **Output**: It displays the extracted username and domain in a formatted string.
