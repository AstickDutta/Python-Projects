# This Python program is a weight converter that converts weight between kilograms and pounds.
# The steps involved are as follows:
# 1. The user is prompted to input their weight as a number.
# 2. The user is then prompted to input the unit of their weight, either 'K' for kilograms or 'L' for pounds.
# 3. If the input unit is 'K' (kilograms), the program converts the weight to pounds (lbs) using the conversion factor 1 kg = 2.20462 lbs.
# 4. If the input unit is 'L' (pounds), the program converts the weight to kilograms (kg) using the conversion factor 1 lb = 0.453592 kg.
# 5. The result is rounded to one decimal place and displayed along with the appropriate unit.
# 6. If the user inputs an invalid unit, the program prints an error message.
